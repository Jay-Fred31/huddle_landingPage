## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I picked this project because I wanted to try my hands on creating a reponsive website. I learnt that it is always better to start from little add-ons like colors, typograpghy before moving on to the functionality of the webpage. 

This style helped me to work through the needs of the webpage without overwheming my stylesheet with too much complicated things at the beginning stage of my design while achieving a fully responsive design.


### Continued development

This project on FrontEnd Mentor has other level of diffulty and I intend to learn further and implement the curvy card designs.

### Useful resources
